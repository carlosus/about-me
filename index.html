        <h2 id="aboutMe">About Me</h2>
        <p>Phoenix, Arizona is the place I'm proud to call home.
            Growing up in the desert developed my appreciation for
            saturated sunsets, cacti, and endless sunshine. 
            Prior to moving to Portland, I moved to Los Angeles where
            I eventually lost count of celebrity sightings. We can talk about that later.
            For a while, I had my eye set on Portland and Alchemy Code Lab 
            was a good enough reason to make the move to the PNW. So now I'm here. YOLO, right!

        <h2 id="likes">Likes</h2>
        <p>I like a lot of things, but there are some things that I like
            more than others. If we're talking about the things I like the most, 
            these are the things that I really, really like:
            <ol id="liBody">
                <li>Burgers</li>
                <li>Sunshine</li>
                <li>Plants</li>
                <li>Cocktails: Old Fashioned</li>
                <li>Reality TV (not a guilty pleasure. I'm open about it)</li>
            </ol>
            Burgers are the way to my heart. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="dislikes">Dislikes</h2>
        <p>These are some of the things that I don't like as much:
            <ul id="liBody">
                <li>Cold Weather</li>
                <li>Small Portions of Fries</li>
                <li>Artichoke Dip</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
